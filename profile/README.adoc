== Why?

* Vehicle software traditionally has been deployed into monolithic, static, standalone modules (components) each with their own complex software development processes. These standalone components are often build as a black box by vendors making the process to update them by OEMs difficult to say the least

* Features and functionality no longer bound to a single module but are https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/definition/distributed-applications-distributed-apps[distributed] across multiple heterogeneous systems/environments each with their own development (and deployment) ecosystem. 

* These new applications require continuous development update (no longer static) to add value to customers for many years 

* There exists many automotive, Internet, etc.. communication protocols each with their own benefits and use cases however they don't play well with each other (no common way to have applications talking in one protocol communicate to another) 

NOTE: The above is not unique to automotive, others face similar challenges (military, aviation, rail, etc...)


== What is Eclipse uProtocol?

A communication protocol that allows apps and services to connect and communicate with each other in a common way regardless of the underlining messaging middleware they run on. Apps and services could be running on the same or different heterogeneous system(s) (uPlatforms), but what remains consistent is the developers mental model for building these apps and services (i.e. APIs & data models).

== How does it work?
Key principles of uProtocol:

- Unified service addressing scheme (uri and specific related to this)
- Supporting fundamental design patterns of rpc and pub/sub, with key properties:
  - Attachment to messages (and automatic transfer of attachments from publisher to subscriber)
  - Permission management
  - Priority management
- Well-defined APIs formalized in protobuf for accessing services
- Developers access services by using generated code from protobuf definitions:
- Code generation is specific to language
- Code generation relies on underlying APIs (packaged in a library called ulink) that are framework-dependent: 
  - uTransport: Send/receive messages
  - RpcClient: Manages client side rpc request-2-response pairing
  - RpcServer: Registers handlers to process requests
- Same subscription API across all platforms, formalized as a service itself (uSubscription service) where the subscription flows across platform/transport boundaries automatically
  - Implementation may be custom to a given platform (not relying on generated code)

Protocol implementation is split up into the following logical components:

- *Core API (uprotocol-core-api):* Project containing the core uProtocol interfaces and data models (defined in protos) that are shared across all programming languages
- *Language Specific SDKs (ex. uprotocol-java):* Contain language specific uProtocol interfaces, data models (not defined in protos), and helper classes/functions
- *uLink Libraries(ex. uprotocol-java-ulink-android):* Implementations of the various uProtocol interfaces (per language) to connect apps and services to each other and a given uPlatform technology
- *uPlatforms (ex. uprotocol-platform-android):* Runtime environment for a given heterogeneous system that contains implementation of the core uProtocol services (uDiscovery, uSubscription, uTwin), along with event dispatchers (uStreamer) to connect uPlatforms to each other
