== Why?

* Vehicle software historically was developed & deployed into monolithic, static, standalone modules, this led to difficulties in updating the software and adding new features

* Takes too long to develop and deploy these apps and services

* Automotive software (applications & services) are no longer disconnected and static but https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/definition/distributed-applications-distributed-apps[distributed] (across multiple heterogeneous environments), and dynamic 

* There was no common language or means for these distributed environments to communicate with each other (missing the glue); ex. some use SOME/IP, others MQTT, DDS, proprietary transports, etc... 


== What is Eclipse uProtocol?

* _The_ glue that binds different communication protocols (automotive, Internet, proprietary, etc...) together
* Transport agnostic (anything from OSI L2 up to L7 protocols and anything in between)
* Ubiquitous language for discovery, subscription, messaging, and more, such that apps and services running on _any_ heterogeneous system can all talk the _same_ language
