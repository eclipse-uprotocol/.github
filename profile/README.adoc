== Why?

* Automotive applications no longer run in a single heterogeneous environment but are instead https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/definition/distributed-applications-distributed-apps[distributed] across multiple heterogeneous systems

* Too steep of a learning curve for developers

* Everyone talks their own `languages` (not just programming languages but communication protocols are very different from automotive-mechatronics, automotive-high-compute, IoT, Cloud, infrastructure, etc...)


== What is Eclipse uProtocol?

* The glue that binds different communication protocols (automotive, Internet, proprietary, etc...) together
* Transport agnostic (you can run it over a link layer protocol, automotive application layer protocol, and anything in-between)
* Ubiquitous language for discovery, subscription, messaging, and more, such that apps and services running on _any_ heterogeneous system can all talk the _same_ language
