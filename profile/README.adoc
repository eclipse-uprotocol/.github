== Why?

* Vehicle software traditionally has been deployed into monolithic, static, standalone modules (components) each with their own complex software development processes. These standalone components are often build as a black box by vendors making the process to update them by OEMs difficult to say the least

* Features and functionality no longer bound to a single module but are https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/definition/distributed-applications-distributed-apps[distributed] across multiple heterogeneous systems/environments each with their own development (and deployment) ecosystem. 

* These new applications require continuous development update (no longer static) to add value to customers for many years 

* There exists many automotive, Internet, etc.. communication protocols each with their own benefits and use cases however they don't play well with each other (no common way to have applications talking in one protocol communicate to another) 

NOTE: The above is not unique to automotive, others face similar challenges (military, aviation, rail, etc...)


== What is Eclipse uProtocol?

A communication protocol that enables a consistent mental model for developers for building apps and services that can connect & communicate with each other in a regardless of the underlining messaging middleware they use or runtime they are deployed on. 

== How does it work?
Key principles of uProtocol:

* Unified service addressing scheme (uri and specific related to this)
* Supporting fundamental design patterns of rpc and pub/sub, with key properties:
  ** Attachment to messages (and automatic transfer of attachments from publisher to subscriber)
  ** Permission management
  ** Priority management
* Well-defined APIs formalized in protobuf for accessing services
* Developers access services by using generated code from protobuf definitions:
* Code generation is specific to language
* Code generation relies on underlying APIs (packaged in a library called uLink) that are framework-dependent: 
  ** uTransport: Send/receive messages over a given messaging middleware (a.k.a transport)
  ** RpcClient: Manages client side rpc request-2-response pairing
  ** RpcServer: Registers handlers to process requests
* Same subscription API across all platforms, formalized as a service itself (uSubscription service) where the subscription flows across platforms and across different transports automatically
  * Implementation may be custom to a given platform (not relying on generated code)

=== Software Development Kit (SDK)
The uProtocol SDK, shown in <<sdk>> below, is used by developers to build apps and services (uEs) for a given platform. The building blocks of the SDK can be found in <<sdk-components>>.

|===
| Component | Description

| *uProtocol Core API* (https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/uprotocol-core-api[uprotocol-core-api])
| Project containing the core uProtocol interfaces and data models (defined in protos) that are shared across all programming languages

| *Language Specific SDKs* (ex. https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/uprotocol-java[uprotocol-java])
| Contain language specific uProtocol interfaces, data models (not defined in protos), and helper classes/functions

| *uLink Library* (ex. https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/uprotocol-java-ulink-android[uprotocol-java-ulink-android])
| Implementations of the various uProtocol interfaces (per language) to connect apps and services to each other and a given uPlatform technology

|===

=== uPlatforms
uPlatforms, shown in <<uprotocol-platform>>, are the applications and services runtime environments per heterogeneous system. uPlatforms contain the core services (uDiscovery, uSubscription, uTwin) and platform-2-platform event dispatchers (uStreamer) required to realize the pub/sub and RPC design patterns across the different communication middlewares and runtime environments.
