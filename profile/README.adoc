== Why?

The automotive industry faces a number of challenges related to software communication:

* In-vehicle communication is largely inherited from legacy architectures that were mostly based on CAN networks. In addition to mechatronics software for which the existing infrastructure was developed, vehicles now include multiple powerful SoCs that run massive amounts of software. This software requires new communications mechanisms.

* Vehicles are now connected to the cloud and other devices (e.g. mobile), and this connectivity requires a communication mechanism that can guarantee properties such as recovery from loss of connection and secure data transmission, driving yet different requirements on the communications framework

* Access to vehicle data from the cloud, and sharing of this data in the cloud, drives yet other requirements such as scaling and reliability

* Despite having varying requirements, all above requirements aim at transferring the same vehicle-related data, and end up being served by the same software components running that produce the data

* Defining specific communication patterns for each and every "environment" drives redundant work, complexity and probable incompatibilities

uProtocol addresses these challenges by providing a small number of communication patterns, exposed with set of programming APIs available and consistent across the vehicle eco-system (in-vehicle ECUs, cloud and mobile), enabling seamless communication between applications and services, wherever they are hosted. Using uProtocol, application developers can focus on the functionality they need to develop, rather than the plumbing necessary to access the relevant services they require, and service providers develop their service once for all consumers, wherever they are hosted.

Many communications frameworks exist, partially covering the automotive needs described above. Rather than developing its own implementation (which is also an option), uProtocol's approach is to "map" its APIs to existing frameworks, and ensure interoperability across them. This approach enables to use and combine multiple communication frameworks, while ensuring end-to-end communication between software components.

NOTE: The above is not unique to automotive, others face similar challenges (military, aviation, rail, etc...)


== What is Eclipse uProtocol?

A communication protocol that enables developers to build apps and services that communicate seamlessly across one of multiple inter-connected messaging middleware.

== How does it work?
*Key principles of uProtocol:*

* Unified service addressing scheme (uri and specific related to this)
* Supporting fundamental design patterns of rpc and pub/sub, with key properties:
  ** Attachment to messages (and automatic transfer of attachments from publisher to subscriber)
  ** Permission & priority management
* Well-defined APIs formalized in protobuf for accessing services
* Developers access services by using generated code from protobuf definitions:
  ** Code generation is specific to language
* Protocol is layered to make it easy for developers to use and implement
* Same subscription API across all platforms, formalized as a service itself (uSubscription service) where the subscription flows across platforms and across different transports automatically
  ** Implementation may be custom to a given platform (not relying on generated code)

=== uProtocol Client Library (uPClient)
uPClient library is the *only* client-facing library that application and service developers require to connect & communication to an <<uProtocol Implementation>>. 

The library is written for a given programming language, ex. https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/up-client-android-java[up-client-android-java], https://github.com/eclipse-uprotocol/up-client-zenoh-rust[up-client-zenoh-rust], etc...

<<projects>> below shows how uPClient library relates to the language specific library (used by all uPClient libraries of the same programming language) and Core-API library that defines the uProtocol interfaces and data models .

=== uProtocol Implementations
uProtocol implementation (shown <<up-implementation>> below) is a runtime environment that applications and services can be deployed to. The implementation requires a key set of services and components to be able to discover, connect, and communicate with other applications/services, anywhere.
