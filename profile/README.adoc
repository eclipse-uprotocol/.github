== Why?

* Vehicle software traditionally has been deployed into monolithic, static, standalone modules (components) each with their own complex software development processes. These standalone components are often build as a black box by vendors making the process to update them by OEMs difficult to say the least

* Features and functionality no longer bound to a single module but are https://www.techtarget.com/searchitoperations/definition/distributed-applications-distributed-apps[distributed] across multiple heterogeneous systems/environments each with their own development (and deployment) ecosystem. 

* These new applications require continuous development update (no longer static) to add value to customers for many years 

* There exists many automotive, Internet, etc.. communication protocols each with their own benefits and use cases however they don't play well with each other (no common way to have applications talking in one protocol communicate to another) 

NOTE: The above is not unique to automotive, others face similar challenges (military, aviation, rail, etc...)


== What is Eclipse uProtocol?

* _The_ glue that binds different communication protocols together

* Transport agnostic (anything from OSI L2 up to L7 protocols and anything in between)

* Ubiquitous language for discovery, subscription, messaging, and more, such that apps and services running on _any_ heterogeneous system can all talk the _same_ language
